# Assignment2 for COSC 520

Before you run any scripts in this repo. Please install all necessary packages by executing the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unit test
In this repo, I also provided a unit test script to verify the correctness of the KD tree.
```
pytest -v test_kdtree2d.py
```
Running the unit test requires pytest installed. So make sure you have all packages in requirements.txt installed.
